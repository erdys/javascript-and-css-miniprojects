## Project list

1. Accordion

Basic accordion utilizing CSS and JS. It operates on accordion elements, enabling users to smoothly expand and collapse sections with a simple click. The script automatically closes the currently open element when the user clicks on another, ensuring a clear and intuitive interface."

2. Button

Dynamic script for button effects. Upon clicking a button, the script generates a visual effect in the form of an animated element (span) that appears at the click location. The script is easy to implement and adds dynamism to the interface, enhancing user experiences during button interactions on the page.
