## JavaScript and CSS - mini projects

Repository of Small Training Projects - a place where I gather and share various small projects that can be useful. Check it out, you might find something interesting!

## Project list

1. Accordion

Basic accordion utilizing CSS and JS. It operates on accordion elements, enabling users to smoothly expand and collapse sections with a simple click. The script automatically closes the currently open element when the user clicks on another, ensuring a clear and intuitive interface."

2. Button

Dynamic script for button effects. Upon clicking a button, the script generates a visual effect in the form of an animated element (span) that appears at the click location. The script is easy to implement and adds dynamism to the interface, enhancing user experiences during button interactions on the page.

3. Dark-Mode

Script handles switching between light and dark color themes on the page. Upon page load, it checks the color preferences of the system or those previously saved in local storage.

For a quick generation of a color palette for a dark background, you can use values in CSS."

```CSS
filter: invert(1) hue-rotate(180deg);
```

or if you want full greyscale dark mode then use

```CSS
filter: invert(1) grayscale(1);
```
